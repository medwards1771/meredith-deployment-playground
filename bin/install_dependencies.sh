# Had to manually create the dir /run/gunicorn in order to generate PID file :scream:

# I ended up getting this to "work" by following Kenneth Roberts's comment from 10/29/23:
# "I can never get this to work through sock file. I can get it to work like so without sock file:
# proxy_pass <http://127.0.0.1:3000≥;" (I changed this to 0.0.0.0:3000)
# is it insecure to rely on 0.0.0.0 instead of sock?

# To try and resolve "sock file not found blah blah error", I ran the command
# `sudo chmod 755 /home/ubuntu`

# To get gunicorn to run w/o error from web server, I needed to manually activate virtual environment
# ssh'd into web server, then from meredith-deploy-playground ran
#    `. .venv/bin/activate`
#    `.venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:flaskr.sock -m 007 flaskr:app

# Had to manually create a /tmp directory to put the systemd file to avoid changing root-level
# permissions at /home/ubuntu or /etc/systemd/system

# Had to manually update nginx config (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/deploying/nginx/) at
# /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Had to manually add dir meredith-deploy-playground in order to nest flaskr dir within that
